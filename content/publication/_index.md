abstract: Using spatial variation in World War I military fatalities in France,
  we show that the scarcity of men due to the war generated an upward shift in
  female labor force participation that persisted throughout the interwar
  period. Available data suggest that increased female labor supply accounts for
  this result. In particular, deteriorated marriage market conditions for single
  women and negative income shocks to war widows induced many of these women to
  enter the labor force after the war. In contrast, demand factors such as
  substitution toward female labor to compensate for the scarcity of male labor
  were of second-order importance.
