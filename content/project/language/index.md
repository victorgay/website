This database contains gender-related language structure data for 492 languages as well as their geographical location. It uses information from the [World Atlas of Language Structures](https://wals.info/) as well as many auxiliary original sources. This dataset is used in Gay et al. ([2013a](https://victorgay.netlify.app/publication/gay_et_al_2013a/), [2013b](https://victorgay.netlify.app/publication/gay_et_al_2013/), [2016a](https://victorgay.netlify.app/publication/gay_et_al_2016/), [2016b](https://victorgay.netlify.app/publication/gay_et_al_2016a/), [2018](https://victorgay.netlify.app/publication/gay_et_al_2018/)).
